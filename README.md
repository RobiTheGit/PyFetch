Whatever comes to mind


# How To Install As a Local Application

# Method 1

*  Rename `main.py` to `pyfetch` (No extension)

*  Move the file into `~/.local/bin/`

# Method 2
* Run `install.sh`

Now that you have "installed" it, type in your console `pyfetch` and you should get the output of the script
